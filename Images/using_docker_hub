Using Docker Hub

If we want to share our Docker images with the world (or just our coworkers), we can create a Docker repository on the Docker Hub found at hub.docker.com (https://hub.docker.com/). Log in or create an account with a username, password, and associated email.

Once logged in, select Repositories, then click the Create Repository button. Give your repo a name; I'll be using the name demo-app. Leave the repo public, and provide no build settings. Create the repo.

From here, we'll want to switch to the command line. To upload our image to the Docker Hub, we'll need to log in from the command line.

docker login --username=<username>
Input the password when prompted.

Before we can push directly to our repo, however, we need to tag our image with the name of our repository in a <username>/<reponame> format. This is done via docker tag.

docker tag appimage <username>/demo-app:latest
We can now use the docker push command to share it.

docker push <username>/demo-app
If we return to our repo in our browser and refresh, then select Tags, we can see the history of our image and share various versions as needed.

Wrap-Up
Use the Docker Hub to host images.
docker login --username=<username>: Log in to your Docker account on the CLI.
docker tag <image> <username>/<reponame>: Tag the image with the repo name.
docker push <username>/<reponame>: Push the image to Docker Hub.
